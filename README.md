# Fix Me - Homework 3
- Download a zip of this project by pressing the green "Code" button
- Unzip the project and load the Fix Game project into Unity Hub and open it up in Unity. 
- Unity will want to boot in "safe mode". Press ignore.
- Make sure you are working in the SampleScene scene - your project will likely not open up to the sample scene so navigate to the Scenes folder and double click it to open it!
- You will be editing the FIXME.cs script as well as checking the Square objects in the scene. 
- Your homework is complete if your script runs without errors and ALL 12 squares are visible when you play the game.
- Submit the your fixed project to Canvas as a zip.
